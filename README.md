# NESJS
An emulator of the 8-bit 6502 based console, Nintendo Entertainment System.
A project I took on because I have always wanted to build a NES emulator, and I have always wanted to see if how well it could be done in JavaScript.

Madness - sure, useless - you bet, but it has been a priceless amount of fun!
